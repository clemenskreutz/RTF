# The Retarded Transient Function Approach (RTF)

This repository contains the plots in the supplemental files of the manuscript "A new approximation approach for transient differential equation models" in high resolution.

The journal did not support files larger than 30 MB, github does not allow files >100 MB. Therefore, the resolution has to be reduced.

Please click at "Code" in order see the files.

Supplementary File 1 shows the RTF approach (blue lines) for all ODE solutions (black lines) from the nine analyzed benchmark models.
The approximation error is denoted in the legends and plotted as gray band.

Supplementary File 2 shows the RTF approach for the 2800 simulated data sets.
The plots are provided in order to allow readers an unbiased impression about the results of the RTF approach.

Supplementary File 3 shows the same outcomes of the RTF approach together with the fitted ODE model and the true ODE solution for all 2800 simulated data sets. These plots indicate differences between the RTF and the ODE modeling approaches.
